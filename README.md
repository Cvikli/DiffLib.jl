# DiffLib.jl
Creating diff that supports wildcard produced by LLMs


# TODO
[ ] Word based diff
[ ] Even character based diff
[ ] find best match should be keeping the order to verify the match. Also should be whitespace sensitive probably. Also LCS could be used here too to check matching line by line.
[ ] Handling consecutive diffs properly
[ ] output generation to be modular
[ ] JS frontend for a merge tool
[ ] multi wildcard handling in typesafe manner ;)
